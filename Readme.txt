I tried to implement MCTS for Battleships, but Couldn't get to work the MCTS part as there wasn't much documentation around the subject, and had to 
follow a Java tutorial regarding he argument. 

The left board is the player board, you click 4 tiles and it and then the game starts, when you click the right tiles, the AI should be able to make a move, but
I couldn't get it work as the tutorial I followed wasn't very clear.
